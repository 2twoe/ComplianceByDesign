Architectural strategies for regulatory compliance in financial systems, with focus on Zimbabwean financial institutions.

## Overview

One of the most critical responsibilities in Enterprise Architecture for banking and financial services is designing solutions that comply with key regulations while supporting business strategy. This repository documents architectural patterns and implementation approaches for regulatory compliance.

## Key Regulatory Frameworks

*The following are examples of regulatory frameworks in Zimbabwe. This guide is customisable and can be adapted for other industries and regions.*

### Zimbabwe-Specific Frameworks examples:
- **Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)** - Supervisory mandate for core financial systems
- **Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU)** - Anti-money laundering measures
- **POTRAZ** - Data protection and privacy compliance under the Cyber and Data Protection Act

### General Compliance Areas (Applicable Globally):
- Data protection (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Financial regulations (Basel III, PCI DSS, etc.)
- Industry-specific requirements

## Architectural Strategies

1. Hybrid On-Premise/Cloud Architecture
2. Data Classification Models
3. Policy-as-Code and Compliance Automation
4. Zero Trust Architecture Principles
5. Compliance-Driven Integration Strategy
